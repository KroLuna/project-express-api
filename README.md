# Project Express API

This week's project is to start my backend journey by creating an API using Express. My API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

## The problem

I think the material was easy to follow and the proble I had was mostly with the deployment. I started with Cloud Run but after lots of try and errors I change to Render and was really easy to deploy.
